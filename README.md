# Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script for real-time face detection using a webcam and OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier. The script captures video from the webcam, processes each frame to detect faces, and displays the frames with rectangles drawn around detected faces.

## Features
- **Real-Time Video Capture**: Captures video feed from the default webcam.
- **Face Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV's Haar cascade classifier to detect faces in each frame.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts frames to grayscale for improved detection performance.
- **Visualization**: Draws rectangles around detected faces and displays the video feed in real-time.
- **Interactive**: Runs until the user presses the 'q' key to exit.
